<p>3. Colonization and Forced Labor

The Taino population quickly declined because of diseases, harsh treatment, and forced labor under the Spanish. To replace the dying native labor force, the Spanish brought enslaved Africans, whose culture and traditions became a major part of Dominican identity.</p>

<p>4. Division of the Island

Over time, the western part of the island was taken by the French and became Haiti. The eastern part continued under Spanish control, but the island changed hands several times, including a period of French rule and later Haitian rule over the entire island.</p>
